# Trilium Tasks

This add-on script for [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) is meant to provide an interface for managing todos and tasks.  It is based loosely on the Task Manager provided in the Trilium Demo, but aims to be more flexible.


## Roadmap and features

These are some high level goals I'd like to accomplish.  Please feel free to suggest additional features/changes/etc.  This list isn't set in stone and will likely change.

- [ ] Basic Todo Management
- [ ] Due date / completion date tracking
- [ ] Tags support
- [ ] List view
- [ ] Table view (same as list?)
- [ ] Kanban view w/ drag and drop
- [ ] Archiving support
- [ ] Context/Location support
- [ ] Custom attributes?
- [ ] HTTP API for external applications to interact with
- [ ] Support for syncing to external task managers - e.g. remember the milk, kanboard, taskwarrior, etc
- [ ] Time tracking
- [ ] Quick add supporting syntax like rtm or taskwarrior
- [ ] Audit/change log to keep track of changes to each task
- [ ] Support for multiple top-level task roots
