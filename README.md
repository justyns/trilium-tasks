# Trilium Tasks

This add-on script for [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) is meant to provide an interface for managing todos and tasks.  It is based loosely on the Task Manager provided in the Trilium Demo, but aims to be more flexible.


## Roadmap and features

These are some high level goals I'd like to accomplish.  Please feel free to suggest additional features/changes/etc.  This list isn't set in stone and will likely change.

- [ ] Basic Todo Management
- [ ] Tags support
- [ ] Archiving support
- [ ] Context/Location support
- [ ] Custom attributes?
- [ ] HTTP API for external applications to interact with
- [ ] Support for syncing to external task managers - e.g. remember the milk, kanboard, taskwarrior, etc


## Alternatives

There are several other task/todo implementations available for Trilium, please have a look at them as well:
